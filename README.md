Actually its more than that, its a  website for you that will allow you to play games with just one link, **ANYWHERE**!.

Here is a list of preferred places to play:
- School
- Work
- Home
- At a friends house
- **ANYWHERE**

So get on that website and have fun!

Also give me some of your links, your non-working/broken links, &amp; question(s) here:

By the way, I am always open for any pull requests and if possible, I will merge it to the main repo so don't be afraid to add anything you think will make the website look better.

A business/corporate style responsive site template. It's pretty barebones but should
go over pretty well for folks wanting to get their serious business on.
